ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our Armenian Telegram bot! We strive to maintain a user-friendly and respectful environment for everyone. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

   1. Be User-Friendly: Interact respectfully with others and maintain a positive atmosphere within the chat. Treat fellow users with kindness and courtesy.

   2. No Bad Words: Refrain from using profanity or offensive language. Keep the conversation clean and appropriate for all ages.

   3. No Spamming: Avoid spamming the chat with repetitive or irrelevant messages. Excessive spamming will result in permanent removal from the chat.

   4. Flooding Policy: To prevent message flooding, users are temporarily restricted from the chat if they send three messages within 30 seconds. This restriction helps maintain a smooth and orderly chat experience.

   5. Karma System: Users' behavior is monitored through a karma system. If a user's karma falls below -2, they will be temporarily blocked from the chat and must contact an admin for resolution.

   6. Admin Control: Admins have the authority to manage users' karma levels. They can raise or lower karma to encourage positive behavior or discourage misconduct.

Thank you for your cooperation in creating a welcoming and respectful community! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to our admins.

This summary effectively communicates the key guidelines and consequences for users, promoting a friendly and respectful environment in your Telegram chat.
